# EdgeVib
This project implements a vibrotactile display (WTD) using a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) and vibration motors arranged in a 2x2 grid. The device uses EdgeWrite patterns to deliver alphanumeric feedback through touch, making it useful for applications in assistive technology and low-vision accessibility.
It also has Arduino code for sine wave simulation on the wrist through five actuators with user given time period(T) as input and delay between each actuator vibration. Each actuator vibrates as per input given b the user which can be adjusted accordingly to sense a continuous sine wave through skin.
And also a simple code for a snake crawling like effect on the wrist using nine actuators.
The actuators used for all these is Linear Resonant Actuators(LRA).
