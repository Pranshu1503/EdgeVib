# EdgeVib
This project implements a vibrotactile display (WTD) using a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) and vibration motors arranged in a 2x2 grid. The device uses EdgeWrite patterns to deliver alphanumeric feedback through touch, making it useful for applications in assistive technology and low-vision accessibility.
It also has Arduino code for sine wave simulation on the wrist through five actuators with user given time period(T) as input. Each actuator vibrates with T/4 interval which can be adjusted by the user accordingly to sense a continuous sine wave through skin.
And also a simple code for a snake crawling like effect on the wrist using nine actuators.
The actuators used for all these is Linear Resonant Actuators(LRA).
