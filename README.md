# EdgeVib
This project implements a vibrotactile display (WTD) using a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) and vibration motors arranged in a 2x2 grid. The device uses EdgeWrite patterns to deliver alphanumeric feedback through touch, making it useful for applications in assistive technology and low-vision accessibility.
